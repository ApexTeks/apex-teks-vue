    <h1>Billing Policy for Apex Technologies For Employers</h1>
    
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Billing Policy details the billing practices and procedures for all products and services offered by Apex Technologies ("we," "us," or "our"). By purchasing our products or services, you agree to comply with this policy. This document aims to provide clear and transparent guidelines regarding billing, payment methods, and dispute resolution.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Billing Cycle</h2>
    <p><strong>How our billing service works:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Initial Charges:</strong> All charges related to job postings are applied at the time you submit your work order request. This ensures that the process is initiated promptly and that resources are allocated appropriately.</li>
        <li><strong>Monthly Billing for Extended Projects:</strong> If the duration of your work order extends beyond a month, our payment system will automatically process charges on a monthly basis. This will continue until the full terms of your work order contract are fulfilled.</li>
        <li><strong>Calculation of Monthly Charges:</strong> For projects lasting more than a month, the total budgeted amount will be divided by the length of the project. The resulting monthly charge will be deducted accordingly. For example, if your project budget is ₦600,000 and the project duration is six months, the monthly charge will be ₦100,000 (₦600,000 ÷ 6 months).</li>
        <li><strong>Payment Failure Consequences:</strong> If we are unable to process your monthly payment at any point, freelancers assigned to your project will be instructed to halt all work immediately. This will occur irrespective of the project's current status, ensuring that unpaid labor is not continued.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Annual/Monthly Billing for Premium Services:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Premium Employer Service:</strong> Opting for the premium version of our employer service will incur additional charges, which can be billed on a monthly or annual basis. These charges are in addition to the standard fees associated with job postings.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>3. Payment Methods</h2>
    <p>We offer a variety of payment methods to accommodate your preferences:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Debit Cards:</strong> We accept major debit cards including Visa and MasterCard.</li>
        <li><strong>Bank Transfers:</strong> Payments can be made directly via bank transfer.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>4. Payment Terms</h2>
    <p>To maintain the integrity and smooth operation of our services, the following payment terms apply:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Due Date:</strong> All payments are due at the time of posting your work order. This ensures immediate allocation and commencement of your project.</li>
        <li><strong>Currency:</strong> All payments must be made in Naira. This standardizes our billing process and avoids complications related to currency exchange.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-Payment Consequences:</strong> If payment is not received at the time of posting your work order, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your job posting. Work will only resume once the outstanding payment is received.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>5. Refunds and Disputes</h2>
    <p><strong>Refunds:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Discretionary Refunds:</strong> Refunds will be issued at our discretion. If you encounter an issue or have a dispute, please contact our support team. We will assess the situation and decide if a refund is warranted based on the specifics of the case.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Billing Disputes:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dispute Resolution:</strong> If you believe there is an error on your invoice, you must notify us in writing within 48 hours of the invoice date. We will review the dispute promptly and adjust the invoice if necessary to correct any errors.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>6. Changes to Billing Policy</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify this Billing Policy at any time. Any changes will become effective immediately upon posting on our website. Your continued use of our services after changes are posted signifies your acceptance of the revised Billing Policy.
